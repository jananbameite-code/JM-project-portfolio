                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">I downloaded the Prusa app and set it for the Prusa Mini+0.4mm nozzle.
I downloaded the nametag 3MF file through a public workshop.
(Operated the app from a mac) went to file → open project→ selected the 3MF file 
I used the scale function to enlarge the tag, and under the name portion I right clicked the text icon under the “keychain-blank.stl” (for the first and last name) and edited the text to say my name. From there I changed the font to the katari font. Using the mouse pad to click the name I was editing and adjusted its alignment to my liking. 
After editing the tag, I decided I wanted to do a color change. To that I clicked slice now and used the vertical toggle bar to animate the printing process by layer adding a “+” , by clicking the bar, to indicate in the g-code to the printer that a pause is to occur, where I will manually load new filament into the Prusa Mini at the layer where I want a color change to happen. 
Lastly, I saved the g-code file to the Usb drive, ejected it, and plugged it into the Prusa Mini and commenced the print. 
                                The print was quick, and the Prusa Mini beeped to indicate a color change, after familiarizing myself with the functions, maneuvering the software felt intuitive.

Common error during print: bed adhesion problem, overhang, and stringing. 
Bed Adhesion Problem: The initial layers printed on the bed failed 2 times. I attempted 3 prints in total, the second print had 2 raft layers added for better adhesion and stability. The print still failed, therefore I added 5 raft layers and it was successful. 

Overhang: There is overhang present on all 8 legs of the spider. This occurred because the support/or the surface area of the legs in the previous layer is not sufficient enough to support the new layer causing the filament to droop over. 

Stringing: There was excessive stringing on the print. This is caused when the nozzle has filament oozing from it while it moves to different locations on the print.

The concept of the Prusa Mini being able to print an object from a set of instructions (g-code) is amazing to think about. Going into this print I assumed that it would not fail, but it did.The Prusa Mini is limited in its size, and its software. If a design is prone to error, the software cannot correct it unless the user corrects it or adds an element to the design that would solve the possible error (i.e. supports, brims, rafts, etc.). This leads me to conclude that many errors stem from user error and improper settings.
* a .stl file formats 3D shapes and designs, but is limited in design specificities. While the .3mf file format can support a wide variety of design specifications like material type (for heating), slice settings, colors, complex design, and etc.*

People with muscular atrophy, children, and the elderly would benefit from the easy to turn knob. During the print process, I ran into an error, Initially there was a bed level issue. I ran a calibration check for a nozzle height of -1.5000, but the issue was not solely the calibration. The metal sheet was improperly placed causing one corner to curve up and impacting the extrusion height and evenness. To fix it, I ran some calibration test, went eye level with the plate, and readjusted the height to -1.47000 then -1.45000. The Tube Squeezer itself is a great concept, however the design is not sturdy enough to withstand excessive twisting. The small end cap is what holds the structure together, but during testing, would easily pop off–causing the whole thing to dismantle. A possible solution would be to make the small end cap a screw, which allows for easier adjustment. This solution would also solve the issue with the large clearance (space between parts), which makes it easy to assemble but not sturdy enough to withstand excessive use.

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-black-50"> Tinkercad is more intuitive and easier to use for creating simple designs. The tutorials are quick and effective, and the software offers built-in shapes that can be easily joined, altered, stacked, and modified. I also found exporting files as an .stl or .3mf simpler in Tinkercad. Unlike Fusion, which requires the design to be saved as a single body before exporting, Tinkercad  recognizes all elements of a design as one automatically.

                                    Fusion feels far less intuitive and more difficult to use compared to Tinkercad. Without a tutorial, it wasn’t immediately clear that I would have to create shapes manually using the loft, point, sketch, extrude functions, etc. While also deciding which coordinate plane to construct the design on. In Fusion, I was constantly aware of the axes throughout the design process, whereas in Tinkercad the user experience makes it easy to overlook or dismiss it. 

                                    The rocketship design in Tinkercad took me about 10 minutes to create. I broke the structure of a rocketship down into simple shapes like cones, cylinders, semi-circles, and triangles–all of which are built-in shapes. I scaled, assembled, aligned, and joined the shapes to my liking, resulting in the end product shown in the image. The rocketship created in Fusion took me about 2 hours to create. Although I followed the same build process of using simple shapes as in Tinkercad, it took me longer to figure out how to stack shapes. I learned that I would have to construct a plane on the surface (on the side where the other shape would be joined) of my base shape, then raise it to the preferred height of my new shape, sketch the base of the new shape on the surface of the base shape, and loft the base to the point to create the new shape. I used this process for the triangular prism, and cones. To construct the cylinder I sketched a circle and used the extrude feature to raise it to my preferred height. I am most satisfied with the Tinkercad version because of the overall experience, however I enjoyed the learning curve involved with Fusion, making the final build feel more accomplished.

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">During the remixing and slicing process, I ran into a few issues and took some notes. Tinkercad can only import files up to 25MB, so I had to compress my .stl file to import it without compromising its quality. For remixing, I used the copy-and-paste function along with the hole function to break apart the original design into parts used for my remix. While in PrusaSlicer, I noticed that the tail was positioned lower than the four legs, so I edited the design in Tinkercad to level it. After uploading the new version to PrusaSlicer, I increased the scale on the X, Y, and Z axis by 157.21%. I then added organic supports on the build plate only, since my design has stability issues. While preparing to print, I encountered a problem with loading the filament. Leftover filament jammed in the extruder nozzle. To fix this, I went into the control settings on the Prusa MINI  and heated the nozzle to 250 degrees. I unscrewed the bolts holding the filament tube, manually pushed the stuck filament through the nozzle, and removed the rest from the top. I then screwed and tightened the tube back onto the printer, successfully loaded the new filament, and began the print.

I inserted the original .stl file by clicking Insert → Insert Mesh. Then, under the Mesh tab, I went to Prepare, selected Generate Face Groups, changed the setting type to Accurate and the boundary tolerance to 0.001mm, clicking “OK” to save. Next, under Modify in the Mesh tab, I clicked Convert Mesh, set the operations to Parametric, and the method to Prismatic. However, this method left me with a partial design. Converting my mesh into an editable body took a considerable amount of time, since the software had to calculate over 10,000 triangular faces within the design. For my second attempt, I did not generate face groups  and instead reduced the number of (triangular) faces under the Mesh tab before converting the mesh using the same settings (Parametric operation and Prismatic method). I then replicated the remix and added a horn to bring back an element from the balloon unicorn for the Fusion version. I kept the PrusaSlicer settings the same for both prints, adding organic supports on the build plate only, since the design has stability issues.

For the Tinkercad version, however, I did encounter print quality issues such as gaps in the infill and under-extrusion. These issues caused my print to be brittle and less visually appealing. Despite this, I believe I successfully achieved my goal of remixing the balloon unicorn into a balloon lizard. To better optimize my design for both softwares, I could have increased the wall thickness around the keychain hole, since the objective of the print was intended for it to function as a keychain, and in its current state it is too fragile to withstand use. I also think that I could have increased the volume of the tail and body to enhance the “balloon look,” which is something that I would change in the future.

I did not find the instruction manual daunting because I have taken on projects with large instruction manuals before. I actually found the manual to be easy to follow and well thought out, especially with the addition of labeled parts and photos. However, the resistors that are color-labeled should include a note specifying the color order in relation to the circuit board or clarify whether their orientation is negligible.

                                        <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">For the first radio, Lauren Swartz and I decided to alternate soldering components onto the circuit board. This method allowed us to learn as we went and develop techniques that better prepared us for the second radio. While alternating, I learned how to use the solder wick and solder sucker and reached a point where my dexterity in handling the iron and solder felt comfortable.</p>

I drew a radio enclosure face that included openings for the on/volume knob, antenna, speaker, light, reset button, and channel change button.
First Print: For measurements concerning the dimensions of the enclosure, 1 mm was added to prevent a tight fit. I used Fusion to create the main portion of my enclosure. I first created a sketch that included all the features presented on the radio face in their proper positions. I used the sketch, extrude, and shell commands to complete my first print. I then saved the body as a mesh and used PrusaSlicer to slice the design.</p>

I increased the diameter of the knob to 15.75 mm for a looser fit, making it easier to turn. I also created a divot on the radio face near the buttons for easier access. To do this, I created a sketch on the back of the face plane and raised it 8.4 mm above the z-axis. I then extruded the build by -8.4 mm so that it made contact with the main body and shelled the rectangle with a 1 mm inner thickness. I used the button and light parameters, placed them accordingly, and negatively extruded them to create openings. I also sketched a circle on the surface for the antenna opening and extruded it to form a hole.

                                        <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">In the original print, the antenna fit into the enclosure but had limited movement since the opening didn’t account for the antenna’s bending. As a result, the antenna’s range of motion was restricted. For the second print, I added a circle with a 10 mm diameter around the antenna joint to allow for full movement. I then joined all the components of the new body together.

I used a “plug” lid concept, shelling a rectangular body at a height of 12 mm and adding rectangular components to each side face at a height of 19 mm, then shelling them to an inside thickness of 1 mm. This design allows the pieces to securely fit together.</p>

Additionally, I added organic supports to the model to prevent overhang issues in my updated design.

There are no signifiers on the fridge to indicate where the handle is located. As a result, the awkward handle placement makes it inconvenient to use, and I have to slightly bend my knees or bend over to reach it. Because of this, I resort to using the gap on the top of the fridge to pry it open with my nails.</p>

                                                <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">I wanted to create a design in Fusion that addressed my being at odds with the built environment around me. To do so, I decided to create a fridge handle that fits snugly onto the door without impeding its function, along with a supplemental storing hook for organization or when I am not using the handle. While brainstorming, I decided to add magnets for extra security and to prevent sliding.</p>
                                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <!--code for space-->

I wanted to use this first design to test dimensions and magnet measurements (depth and diameter). My first print was almost perfect, but the magnet holes were a bit tight. To solve this, Professor Krones and I used a heat gun to melt the PLA slightly, then pressed the magnets in. It worked, but some of the magnets rested above the surface level of the face that would rest on the fridge. To fix this, I adjusted the depth from 2.66 mm to 2.75 mm and the diameter from 6 mm to 6.35 mm. I kept all other measurements the same. I tested the magnet fit with the new print, and it was perfect. The magnets were level with the surface and did not slip out, but I added glue for extra reinforcement.</p>
                                                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <!--code for space-->
                                                        <p class="mb-0 text-black-50">I then began designing the handle. I created a hook that wrapped around the wall of the fridge door and used shapes like an elliptical prism and rectangles to create a space 25 mm wide, comfortable enough for my hand to wrap around, with an inner length of 89 mm, long enough for my hand to fit completely with extra room. Before slicing both the handle and the storing hook, I added organic supports to avoid print issues due to the many overhangs present in the design. The first print for the handle was perfect; all components of the design fit perfectly.</p>

It was the fastest I have ever created a design, and my fluency in the software is improving. Overall, this project was a great experience, and I appreciated how open it was.
